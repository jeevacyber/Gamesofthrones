## 🐉 DRAGON WALLPAPER SETUP

### CURRENT STATUS:
✅ **Image Downloaded:** valid `dragon.jpg` from **Wallhaven** (zm9dvw) is now in your `public` folder.
✅ **Configuration:** Round 2 is set to use this image as the background.
✅ **Visibility:** Light overlay (20%) added to ensure text is readable while keeping the image clear.
✅ **Fallback:** If the image is ever deleted, a high-quality backup will load automatically.

### WANT TO CHANGE IT?
If you want to use a *different* image later:
1. Rename your new image to `dragon.jpg`
2. Replace the file in: `d:\dragon-dragon-ctf-main\dragon-dragon-ctf-main\public\dragon.jpg`
3. Refresh the page!
